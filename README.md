# Cancer Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a cancer dataset to predict whether
a tumor is benign or malignant using data analysis and machine
learning techniques. The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven
approaches can support medical decision-making.

## Dataset

* Medical dataset containing tumor-related features
* Includes measurements such as cell size, texture, and shape
* Used for classification of cancer cases

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn

## Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature selection and scaling
5. Model training and evaluation
6. Result interpretation

## Outcome

The model classifies cancer cases as benign or malignant based on
input features, highlighting the application of machine learning
in healthcare data analysis.

## Future Improvements

* Try different classification algorithms
* Improve feature engineering
* Perform hyperparameter tuning
